### Basic Networking Concepts:
1. What is the difference between TCP and UDP? Provide examples of protocols using each.
2. Explain the OSI and TCP/IP models. Which layers are involved in data encryption?
3. What is a subnet, and why is it used in networking?
4. Explain the difference between a public IP and a private IP.
5. What is NAT (Network Address Translation), and why is it used?

### Security-Focused Questions:
6. What is a firewall, and how does it help in securing a network?
7. Explain the concept of VPNs. How do they secure data transmission?
8. What is the difference between IDS and IPS?
9. How does SSL/TLS ensure secure communication over the internet?
10. What is port scanning? How would you detect and prevent it?

### Advanced Networking Concepts:
11. What is the difference between a hub, switch, and router?
12. How does ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) work? What is ARP spoofing?
13. What are VLANs, and how can they enhance network security?
14. Explain DNS and how DNS spoofing works.
15. What are the differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption in network communication?

### Practical Scenarios:
16. How would you secure a wireless network?
17. Describe a DDoS attack. How would you mitigate one in real time?
18. How would you detect and respond to a rogue device on your network?
19. If a machine on the network is infected with malware, what steps would you take to isolate and secure the network?
20. How would you secure a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) environment in an organization?

### Troubleshooting & Analysis:
21. A client reports they can’t access a website. How would you troubleshoot?
22. How do you use packet analysis tools like Wireshark for network security purposes?
23. What steps would you take to identify the source of a network breach?
24. How would you secure data in transit over an untrusted network?
25. What is the role of a DMZ in network security?
